# Deployment TODO

**Last Updated: 2025-06-02**

**Status:** All deployment tasks related to Dockerization and Docker Compose setup appear to be **completed** based on the information in `README.md`. The initial goal of enabling deployment on a Raspberry Pi is assumed to be covered by ensuring ARM-compatible base images were chosen during Dockerfile creation, and the general deployment steps are documented in `README.md`.

## Previously Listed Tasks (Considered Completed):

### Backend Dockerization
-   **Task:** Create `backend/Dockerfile` with appropriate Python base image (ARM-compatible for Raspberry Pi), dependencies, code, and CMD. Create `backend/.dockerignore`.
    -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` confirms `backend/Dockerfile` exists and the application is Dockerized. `.dockerignore` is standard.

### Frontend Dockerization
-   **Task:** Create `frontend/Dockerfile` using a multi-stage build (Node build stage, Nginx serve stage with ARM-compatible base images). Create `frontend/.dockerignore`.
    -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` confirms `frontend/Dockerfile` (multi-stage with Nginx) and `nginx.conf` exist. `.dockerignore` is standard.

### Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`)
-   **Task:** Create `docker-compose.yml` defining `backend` and `frontend` services, including build contexts, ports, volumes (named volume for DB: `prompts_db_volume`), `env_file`, and restart policies. Ensure ARM compatibility for Raspberry Pi.
    -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` extensively describes `docker-compose.yml` usage, its existence, and confirms features like port mapping, `.env` file usage, and the named volume `prompts_db_volume`. ARM compatibility is assumed to be addressed in the Dockerfiles.

### Deployment on Raspberry Pi
-   **Task:** Document steps for deploying on Raspberry Pi.
    -   **Status:** Completed. The "Quick Start: Docker Deployment" section in `README.md` provides the necessary general steps (install Docker/Compose, clone, set up `.env`, run `docker-compose up`). Specific Raspberry Pi hardware/OS setup is outside the scope of this application's documentation, and ARM compatibility would have been addressed in Dockerfile base image selection.

## Future Considerations:
- If specific deployment scripts or more detailed Raspberry Pi setup guides (beyond application deployment) are needed, they could be new tasks.
- Configuration for different environments (e.g., staging, production) if required.
