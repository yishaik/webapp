# Documentation & Review TODO

**Last Updated: 2025-06-02**

**Status:** Most documentation tasks appear to be **completed**, with `README.md` and `SECURITY.md` covering the key areas. `README.md` is comprehensive.

## `README.md` Updates

-   **Task:** Review `README.md` for accuracy and completeness as features are implemented.
    -   **Status:** Completed / Ongoing. `README.md` appears accurate and complete based on the current project state. Continuous review is good practice.
-   **Quick Start / Setup Instructions:**
    -   **Task:** Verify backend and frontend setup commands.
        -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` focuses on Docker-based setup, which is well-documented. Local setup (non-Docker) was noted as potentially in `CLAUDE.md` (not reviewed here) but Docker is the primary documented method.
    -   **Task:** Add testing commands.
        -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` includes a "Running Tests" section.
    -   **Task:** Add Docker Compose deployment commands.
        -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` includes these in "Running the Application".
-   **Features List:**
    -   **Task:** Ensure it accurately reflects implemented features.
        -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` has a detailed features list.
-   **Tech Stack:**
    -   **Task:** Confirm it matches choices.
        -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` lists the tech stack.
-   **API Documentation Link:**
    -   **Task:** Ensure `http://localhost:8000/docs` is mentioned.
        -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` correctly links to the backend API docs.
-   **Environment Variable Setup in `README.md`:**
    -   **Task:** Mention `.env` file, refer to `.env.example` and `SECURITY.md`.
        -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` covers this under "Prerequisites" and "Environment Variables & Configuration", referencing `backend/.env.example`.

## Environment Variable Documentation

-   **Task:** Create/Update `.env.example`.
    -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` confirms `backend/.env.example` is the template and lists the required API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
    -   **Location Clarification:** `README.md` specifies `backend/.env.example` as the template to be copied to `backend/.env`. This is clear and actionable. `SECURITY.md`'s instructions are slightly more general but do not contradict the content or purpose.
-   **Task:** Update `README.md` or `SECURITY.md` with clear instructions for `.env` file usage.
    -   **Task:** Document copying `.env.example` to `.env`.
        -   **Status:** Completed. Both `README.md` (for `backend/.env.example`) and `SECURITY.md` provide these instructions.
    -   **Task:** List required environment variables.
        -   **Status:** Completed. Both files list the necessary API keys.
    -   **Task:** Reiterate `.env` should not be committed.
        -   **Status:** Completed. `SECURITY.md` clearly states this and mentions `.gitignore` coverage.

## General Project Structure Documentation

-   **Task:** Consider adding a project directory structure section to `README.md`.
    -   **Status:** Completed. `README.md` includes a "Project Structure" section.

## Future Considerations:
- Periodically review `README.md` as the project evolves.
- If local (non-Docker) setup becomes a primary documented path, ensure those instructions are added or updated in `README.md`.
