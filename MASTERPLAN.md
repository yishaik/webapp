# MASTERPLAN.md

**Last Updated: 2025-06-02**

**Overview:**
This document originally outlined a phased development approach for the PromptForge application, along with identifying missing parts from initial specifications and suggesting future improvements.

As of the last update, the core features of the PromptForge application, as detailed in `README.md`, have been implemented. All associated `TODO_*.md` files have been refactored to reflect that their listed tasks are completed, and these files now primarily serve as historical records of the development process.

The `README.md` file provides the most current overview of the application's features, tech stack, setup, and usage. The individual `TODO_*.md` files detail the completion of tasks related to API integrations, core backend logic, database setup, frontend components, deployment, documentation, and testing infrastructure.

**Original Development Phases (Completed):**
The application was developed through a phased approach:
1.  **Core Backend and API Foundations:** Established basic services, database, and initial API integration.
2.  **Basic Frontend and Core Logic Implementation:** Created a minimal viable product with an end-to-end flow.
3.  **Expanding Functionality and Integrations:** Added more LLM integrations and enhanced core logic.
4.  **Testing, Documentation, and Deployment:** Ensured application quality, provided documentation, and prepared for Docker-based deployment.
5.  **Advanced Features and Refinements:** Implemented prompt history and laid the groundwork for further enhancements.

All these phases are now considered complete with respect to the features described in `README.md`.

**Resolved Items:**
Initial points of clarification or "missing parts" (such as User Model details for basic auth, `.env.example` location, and basic error handling/state management) have been addressed during development and are reflected in the current state of the application and its documentation (primarily `README.md` and `SECURITY.md`).

**Current Purpose of this Document:**
This `MASTERPLAN.md` now primarily serves to:
- Acknowledge the completion of the initial development plan.
- Retain the list of "Suggestions for Future Improvements" which can guide further development efforts beyond the current feature set.

Refer to `README.md` for the current application status and to the individual `TODO_*.md` files for the historical task completion details.

## Suggestions for Future Improvements (Beyond current MVP)

1.  **Advanced Prompt Optimization Techniques:**
    *   Explore more sophisticated optimization strategies (e.g., few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, context stuffing based on model context window size).
    *   Allow users to select or customize optimization techniques.

2.  **Prompt Templates/Library:**
    *   Allow users to save and reuse successful prompt structures or templates.

3.  **Cost Estimation:**
    *   For APIs that charge per token, provide a rough cost estimate before sending a prompt (this is complex and requires token counting and pricing info).

4.  **Streaming Responses:**
    *   For LLMs that support streaming, update the frontend and backend to handle streamed responses for better perceived performance.

5.  **Vision/Multimodal Input in UI:**
    *   If models like Gemini or GPT-4 Vision are used, extend the UI to allow image uploads or other multimodal inputs. (Reference: `GEMINI_API_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `OPENAI_API_INSTRUCTIONS.md`).

6.  **Detailed Model Capability Tags/Filters:**
    *   Beyond just names, tag models with capabilities (e.g., "strong reasoning," "creative," "coding," "multimodal") to help users select.

7.  **Export/Import Functionality:**
    *   Allow users to export their prompt history or import prompts.

8.  **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Dark mode.
    *   More responsive design for various screen sizes.
    *   Loading skeletons or more detailed loading states.

9.  **Security Enhancements (if ever exposed beyond local network):**
    *   Move beyond basic auth (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
    *   More robust input sanitization.
    *   API rate limiting on backend endpoints.

10. **Version Control for Prompts:**
    *   If a user iterates on a base prompt multiple times, allow them to see versions or revert.

11. **Configuration for Models via Backend Endpoint:**
    *   Fetch model names, capabilities, and potential specific parameters from a backend configuration endpoint for easier updates and maintenance, rather than hardcoding in the frontend.

12. **Enhanced Error Handling and Frontend Feedback:**
    *   Provide more specific and user-friendly error messages from the backend to the frontend (e.g., API key invalid, model unavailable, rate limits hit).
