Here's a comprehensive and up-to-date plan for building a local, single-user web application that serves as a prompt builder and optimizer for major language models, including OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), xAI (Grok), and Google Gemini. 


---

üß Project Overview

Goal: Develop a web application hosted on a Raspberry Pi that assists users in crafting optimized prompts tailored to specific tasks and language models. The application will: 

Collect the user's initial prompt.

Generate a dynamic questionnaire to refine the prompt based on the intended task and model.

Optimize the prompt for the selected language model.

Provide recommendations and allow users to compare outputs across different models.

Maintain a history of prompts and interactions for future reference.

üß Key Features

1. Initial Prompt Collection:

Simple interface for users to input their base prompt. 



2. Dynamic Questionnaire:

Questions adapt based on the initial prompt to gather more context (e.g., desired tone, format, length). 



3. Model Selection & Comparison:

Users can choose from OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Google Gemini models.

Option to run the optimized prompt across multiple models and compare outputs side by side. 



4. Prompt Optimization:

Tailor prompts to leverage specific features and strengths of each selected model. 



5. Recommendations:

Suggest the most suitable model(s) based on the task and desired outcome. 



6. History & Persistence:

Store past prompts, questionnaire responses, and model outputs in a local database for future reference.

üß Data Flow

1. User Input:

User enters the base prompt. 



2. Questionnaire Generation:

Based on the prompt, generate follow-up questions to gather more context. 



3. Model Selection:

User selects desired language model(s) for optimization. 



4. Prompt Optimization:

Tailor the prompt to align with the selected model's capabilities and requirements. 



5. API Request:

Send the optimized prompt to the selected model(s) via their respective APIs. 



6. Response Handling:

Display model outputs side by side for comparison. 



7. Persistence:

Store the entire interaction (prompt, questionnaire responses, model outputs) in the local database.

üß Testing & Validation

Unit Testing: Test individual components (e.g., questionnaire generation, prompt optimization).

Integration Testing: Ensure seamless interaction between frontend, backend, and APIs.

User Testing: Gather feedback from the intended user to refine the UI/UX. 



---

üö Deployment

Containerization: Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployment.

Hosting: Deploy on Raspberry Pi using Docker Compose for managing multiple services (frontend, backend, database).

Security: Implement basic authentication and secure API key storage.
