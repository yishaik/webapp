# Google Gemini API Instructions

This document provides a summary of instructions and capabilities for the Google Gemini API based on the provided documentation. For detailed SDK usage and the most up-to-date examples, please refer to the official [Google AI for Developers documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) and the [Gemini API getting started Colab](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/get-started/tutorial?lang=colab).

## Key Capabilities & Features:

The Gemini API offers a range of powerful features for building AI applications:

*   **Multimodal Understanding:** Gemini can process and understand various types of input, including text, images, audio, and video.
    *   Learn more about [vision understanding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/vision).
    *   Learn more about [audio understanding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/audio).
    *   Explore [multimodal file prompting strategies](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting_strategies#multimodal-file-prompting).
*   **Semantic Retrieval:** This feature allows you to generate embeddings for your content and store it, enabling efficient information retrieval. It can be used as an alternative to a separate vector database.
*   **Attributed Question Answering (AQA):** The AQA Gemini model variant is tuned for answering questions using source material provided in a prompt. It's often used with Semantic Retrieval.
*   **Function Calling:** Enables the model to interact with external systems and APIs by transforming natural language requests into structured API calls. This is showcased in the [SQL Talk project](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/tutorials/sql-talk).
*   **System Instructions:** You can provide system-level instructions to guide the model's behavior and responses. More details can be found [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/system-instructions).

## Example Projects & Use Cases:

The documentation highlights several example projects that leverage the Gemini API:

*   **Docs Agent:** An application to chat with your documents, using Semantic Retrieval and the AQA model. (See [Docs Agent Tutorial](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/tutorials/docs-agent))
*   **Slides Advisor:** A Google Workspace Add-on that reviews Google Slides presentations using Gemini's image and text processing. (See [Slides Advisor Tutorial](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/tutorials/slides-advisor))
*   **Wordcraft:** An AI-powered story writing tool. (See [Wordcraft Tutorial](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/tutorials/wordcraft))
*   **SQL Talk:** An AI data exploration agent that converts natural language questions about business data into SQL queries or API calls. (See [SQL Talk Tutorial](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/tutorials/sql-talk))

## General Implementation Notes:

*   While specific code examples for basic API calls are best found in the official SDK documentation and Colabs, projects like "Slides Advisor" show how system prompts (`SYSTEM_PROMPT`) are used to guide the model's output.
*   For testing local projects built with Gemini, you typically run a local development server and access it via a URL like `http://your-hostname-here:5000` (example from Docs Agent).

## Getting Started:

1.  **Explore the [Gemini API getting started Colab](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/get-started/tutorial?lang=colab).** This is the recommended starting point for hands-on experience.
2.  Review the tutorials for example projects (linked above) to understand practical applications.
3.  Consult the official Gemini API documentation for detailed information on SDKs, authentication, and specific features.
