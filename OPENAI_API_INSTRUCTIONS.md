# OpenAI API Instructions

This document provides general guidance for using the OpenAI API. Based on the provided information, a direct link to the OpenAI documentation was unavailable during the last check. **Always refer to the official [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) for the most current and comprehensive instructions, SDKs, and examples.**

## Key Capabilities & Features (General):

OpenAI APIs typically provide access to powerful language models (like GPT-3.5, GPT-4) with capabilities including:

*   Text generation and completion.
*   Chat-based interactions.
*   Embeddings generation.
*   Fine-tuning models (on some versions/models).
*   Vision capabilities (with newer models like GPT-4 Turbo with Vision).
*   Function calling and tool use.

## Using the OpenAI Python SDK (General Example Structure):

Below is a general structure for how you might use the OpenAI Python SDK. Specific model names, parameters, and methods will vary based on your task and the current API version.

1.  **Installation:**
    ```bash
    pip install openai
    ```

2.  **Initialization & Usage:**
    Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable or pass it directly during client initialization.

    **Python Example (Conceptual - check official docs for specifics):**
    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI
    import os

    # It's recommended to set your API key as an environment variable:
    # export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
    
    # client = OpenAI()
    # or, if not using environment variable for the key:
    # client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")

    # Assuming OPENAI_API_KEY is an environment variable:
    client = OpenAI(
        api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY") # Replace with your actual key if not using env var
    )

    # Example: Chat Completion (using a newer model like gpt-4o or gpt-4-turbo)
    # try:
    #     response = client.chat.completions.create(
    #         model="gpt-4o",  # Or your desired model, e.g., "gpt-4-turbo", "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    #         messages=[
    #             {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    #             {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"}
    #         ]
    #     )
    #     print(response.choices[0].message.content)
    # except Exception as e:
    #     print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    # Example: Text Completion (older style, less common for chat models now)
    # try:
    #     response = client.completions.create(
    #         model="text-davinci-003", # Example older model, check current availability
    #         prompt="Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, world!'",
    #         max_tokens=60
    #     )
    #     print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
    # except Exception as e:
    #     print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    ```
    *Note: The exact methods (`client.chat.completions.create`, `client.completions.create`) and parameters depend on the OpenAI SDK version and the specific task (chat vs. completion) and model you are using. Always consult the latest official OpenAI documentation.* Access to `os.environ` might be restricted, ensure your API key is securely managed.

## Important Considerations:

*   **API Key Management:** Securely manage your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Using environment variables is highly recommended.
*   **Model Selection:** Choose the model that best fits your task requirements (capabilities, cost, context length). Refer to OpenAI's model documentation for details on available models (e.g., GPT-4 series, GPT-3.5 series).
*   **Rate Limits:** Be aware of API rate limits and usage tiers.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your application.
*   **Content Policy:** Adhere to OpenAI's usage policies and safety guidelines.

## Getting Started:

1.  Sign up for an OpenAI API account on the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
2.  Obtain your API key.
3.  Review the [official API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) for quickstart guides, API references, and examples.
4.  Explore the OpenAI Cookbook for practical examples and guides.
